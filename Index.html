<p>I am seeking opportunity in Data Analytics.  I am relatively new to this field but I do possess the technical skills associated with these job functions.  I will soon be completing an intensive study program in Data Analytics at Case Western University in Cleveland, Ohio.  I currently have an understanding in SQL, Python, Excel and Web Applications.  I will also learn ETL, Javascript, D3, R, and Tableau.<p/>
<p>I have an Undergraduate Degree in Finance and worked in the Mortgage Industry for nearly 10 years.  I then held Small Business Ownership in Food Preparation and Health/Wellness for 10 years.  I have again been working corporately for just over two years now.  I have sought education to transition my career in to Analytics.  I thoroughly enjoy working with numbers and data sets.  This is an appropriate field for my intellectual traits.<p/>
